# test-nx

Playing with nx.dev

## TLDR;

- It might be good when heavily customized
- For teams perhaps is a must
- For solo projects is overwhelming

## Cons

- Bloated:
  - No yarn support because of an Angular package
- Opinionated:
  - When Emotion selected the `@emotion/styled` package is loaded
  - Automatic `.vscode` folder created
  - For `TypographicGrid` a `typographic-grid` folder is created
- Cannot generate pure TS (node) package
- Publishing a little weird: https://nx.dev/latest/angular/workspace/structure/buildable-and-publishable-libraries

## Pros

- The package name will be `@somenage/edo`
